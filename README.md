# liecasadi

`liecasadi` implements Lie groups operation written in CasADi, mainly directed to optimization problem formulation.

Inspired by [A micro Lie theory for state estimation in robotics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01537.pdf) and the library [Manif](https://github.com/artivis/manif).

## Install
